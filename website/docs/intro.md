# Introduction to ROS 2 Robotics Education

Welcome to the ROS 2 Robotics Education Module! This course is designed for AI students new to robotics who have basic Python knowledge. Our goal is to introduce you to ROS 2 as the middleware that connects AI agents to humanoid robot bodies.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture, including nodes, topics, and services
- **Python Agents with rclpy**: Learn to create Python-based ROS 2 nodes and implement the publish/subscribe model
- **Humanoid Description with URDF**: Explore URDF concepts, links and joints, and how to model humanoid structures

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- AI students new to robotics
- Developers with basic Python knowledge
- Anyone interested in connecting AI logic to robot systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts
- Interest in robotics and AI integration

## Course Structure

The course is organized into progressive modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn the basics of ROS 2 architecture and communication
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation** - Understand digital twins, physics simulation with Gazebo, and sensor simulation for robotics
3. **Module 3: AI-Robot Brain** - Advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technologies
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Vision-Language-Action systems for autonomous humanoid behavior driven by natural human commands

Each module builds on the previous one, following a progressive difficulty approach with practical examples.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain ROS 2 architecture and communication principles
- Use Python (rclpy) to interface AI logic with robots
- Understand humanoid structure via URDF concepts
