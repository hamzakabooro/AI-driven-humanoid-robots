# Chapter 1 Assessment: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Multiple Choice Questions

### Question 1
What is the primary purpose of ROS 2 in Physical AI applications?
A) To provide hardware components for robots
B) To serve as middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robot bodies
C) To replace traditional programming languages
D) To manage robot hardware maintenance

**Correct Answer:** B

### Question 2
Which of the following best describes a ROS 2 node?
A) A physical component of a robot
B) A process that performs computation
C) A type of sensor
D) A communication protocol

**Correct Answer:** B

### Question 3
What type of communication pattern do ROS 2 topics use?
A) Request/response
B) One-to-one direct connection
C) Publish/subscribe (many-to-many)
D) Broadcast only

**Correct Answer:** C

## Short Answer Questions

### Question 4
Explain the distributed robot control model and its advantages in ROS 2.

**Expected Answer:** The distributed model allows different parts of a robot system to run on different machines, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, flexibility, and resource optimization.

### Question 5
Describe the difference between topics and services in ROS 2 communication.

**Expected Answer:** Topics use a publish/subscribe model (many-to-many, loose coupling) while services use a request/response model (one-to-one, direct connection).
