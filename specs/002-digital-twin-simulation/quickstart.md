# Quickstart: Digital Twin Simulation Module

## Prerequisites

Before starting Module 2, students should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (completed Module 1)
- Familiarity with command line operations
- Basic Python knowledge
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software

## Setup Requirements

### For Gazebo Simulation:
- ROS 2 installation (Humble Hawksbill or later recommended)
- Gazebo Garden or Fortress
- Basic ROS 2 workspace setup

### For Educational Content:
- Web browser to access Docusaurus documentation
- No additional software needed for reading content and completing assessments

## Getting Started

1. **Review Module 1 Concepts**: Ensure you understand ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, and services
2. **Chapter 1**: Start with "Digital Twins in Robotics" to understand the foundational concepts
3. **Chapter 2**: Move to "Physics Simulation with Gazebo" to learn practical simulation skills
4. **Chapter 3**: Complete "Sensor Simulation" to understand how virtual sensors work with ROS 2
5. **Assessments**: Complete the assessments for each chapter to validate your understanding

## Key Concepts to Master

- Digital twin methodology in robotics
- Physics simulation principles (gravity, collisions, dynamics)
- Sensor simulation techniques (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- Integration of simulated sensors with ROS 2

## Common Learning Path

1. Understand what a digital twin is and why it's important in robotics
2. Learn how to set up basic physics simulations in Gazebo
3. Explore how virtual sensors generate data for ROS 2
4. Practice connecting simulation data to perception pipelines
5. Apply knowledge through practical exercises

## Next Steps

After completing Module 2, students will be prepared for:
- Module 3: Humanoid Description with URDF
- Advanced ROS 2 simulation techniques
- Real-world robot deployment using simulation-tested algorithms
